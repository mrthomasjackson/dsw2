          <strong>Scuba diving</strong> is a form of underwater diving in which a diver uses a self contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) to breathe underwater.[1]
          Unlike other modes of diving, which rely either on breath-hold or on air pumped from the surface, scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas,
          usually compressed air,[2] allowing them greater freedom of movement than with an air line or diver's umbilical and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold.
          Scuba equipment may be open circuit, in which exhaled gas is expelled to the surroundings, or a closed or semi-closed circuit rebreather, in which the breathing
          gas is scrubbed to remove carbon dioxide, and the oxygen used is replenished from a supply of feed gas before being re-breathed.A scuba diver usually moves
          around underwater by using fins attached to the feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          By the early twentieth century, two basic templates for scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's
          exhaust is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the diver's unused oxygen is filtered from the carbon dioxide and recirculated.
        </p>

        <h3>Rebreathers</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>closed-circuit</em> rebreathers were first developed for military use, due to their stealth advantages. The first commercially successful closed-circuit scuba
          was designed and built by English diving engineer, Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London.[3][4] His self contained breathing apparatus
          consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with (estimated) 50-60% O2 supplied from a copper tank and CO2 scrubbed by rope yarn soaked in a solution
          of caustic potash; the system giving a duration of about three hours.[4][5] Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, perfected the oxygen rebreather in 1910[4][6]
          with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first practical rebreather to be made in quantity.[7] Rebreathers have been increasingly used by
          civilians for recreation, especially since the end of Cold War. This reduced the perceived risk of attack by Communist Bloc forces, including by their combat divers.
          After that, the world's armed forces had less reason to requisition civilian rebreather patents, and automatic and semi-automatic recreational diving rebreathers started to appear.
